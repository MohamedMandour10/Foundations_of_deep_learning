# Foundations of Deep Learning
This repository contains code examples and explanations for fundamental concepts in deep learning. The topics covered in this repository are:

* Gradient Descent
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Backpropagation
* PyTorch
* Supervised Learning
* Automated Differentiation from Scratch
##  Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a model by iteratively adjusting the model parameters. The algorithm works by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters and taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient. This process is repeated until the cost function reaches a minimum.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent
Stochastic Gradient Descent is an extension of Gradient Descent that uses random subsets of the training data to estimate the gradient of the cost function. This allows for faster convergence and better generalization to unseen data.

## Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a technique used to calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter in a neural network. This technique allows for efficient optimization of complex models with many parameters.

## PyTorch
PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training neural networks. It provides automatic differentiation, GPU acceleration, and many other features that make it a powerful tool for deep learning research and development.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is a machine learning technique where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping between inputs and outputs that can generalize to unseen data.

## Automated Differentiation from Scratch
Automated Differentiation is a technique used to calculate the gradient of a function with respect to its inputs. This is essential for training neural networks using gradient-based optimization algorithms. In this repository, we will implement automated differentiation from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of how it works.
